<hr>

<h2>Ethics and Leadership</h2>

<h3>Ethical Dilemma: Misuse of Administrative Privileges</h3>

<p>
System administrators often have elevated access to sensitive data and systems. An ethical dilemma arises
when such access is used for purposes outside professional responsibility. While organizations may respond
through audits and disciplinary actions, ethical behavior ultimately depends on individual integrity.
</p>

<p>
This dilemma reinforced my belief that agency and values must guide technical ability. As a disciple of Jesus
Christ, I am accountable for how I use entrusted authority, both professionally and spiritually.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Reflection: Spiritual and Professional Integration</h2>

<p>
Serving as a temple worker and coordinator taught me the power of preparation and reverence. Arriving early
to meditate and invite the Spirit brought peace, joy, and a stronger desire to serve others. This experience
shaped how I lead, prepare, and interact with others professionally.
</p>

<p>
My spiritual discipline strengthens my professional conduct, and my professional growth deepens my
spiritual maturity. When faith, effort, and integrity are aligned, they form a strong foundation for lifelong
growth.

  <h2>Network Administration Project – Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    The Network Configuration and Systems Administration project represents a
    meaningful application of the technical and ethical principles developed
    throughout my coursework. The project demonstrates practical skills in
    configuring network infrastructure, managing core services such as DHCP and
    DNS, and ensuring reliable connectivity across systems. More importantly, it
    reflects my growing understanding of how technical decisions directly affect
    security, trust, and long-term system sustainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the key challenges addressed during refinement was improving clarity,
    scalability, and maintainability. While the original configuration met
    functional requirements, the project was strengthened through clearer
    documentation and improved structural organization. These refinements ensure
    the system can be easily understood and maintained by other administrators,
    reducing operational risk and supporting long-term continuity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ethical considerations were intentionally integrated through improved access
    control and accountability. Administrative privileges were refined to align
    with the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have access
    necessary for their responsibilities. Documentation practices were also
    enhanced to promote transparency, traceability, and responsible system
    management.
  </p>

  <p>
    These refinements had a direct impact on both technical quality and ethical
    alignment. The system became more secure, scalable, and maintainable, while
    also reflecting professional responsibility and trustworthiness. This
    project demonstrates how ethical leadership in IT is expressed through
    everyday configuration and design decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, this experience strengthened my ability to approach IT work with
    intentionality, discipline, and accountability. It reinforced the idea that
    effective technology solutions require both technical expertise and ethical
    awareness, preparing me to serve organizations and communities responsibly
    through technology.
  </p>

    <h2>Future Direction</h2>

<p>
I am committed to continued learning, ethical leadership, and service-oriented technology practice. This
portfolio will continue to evolve as I gain experience, pursue advanced certifications, and grow as both an
IT professional and disciple-leader.
</p>
    <section id="week5" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 3rem auto; padding: 1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    
      <h1>Integration, Reflection, and Design Enhancement</h1>
    
      <h2>Task 1: Comprehensive Reflection on Christlike Attributes and Personal Warning Signs</h2>
    
      <p>
        Throughout the process of creating my Professional Growth Portfolio, I have come to realize that Christlike attributes are not merely ideals but are instead actions that shape personal character traits and professional behaviors. These traits, such as patience, integrity, humility, and charity, affect how I react when I am under pressure, how I resolve conflicts, and how I interact with people. The Lord’s commandment, “In your patience possess ye your souls” (Luke 21:19), has become more personal to me as I navigate the demands of my technical field, time constraints, and leadership responsibilities.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        One of the most significant aspects of my growth has been the recognition of personal warning signs that may lead me away from Christlike behavior. These signs include getting frustrated when systems don’t work, getting impatient when I am under time constraints, and getting tempted to become efficient at the expense of being empathetic. Through this growth experience, I learned how to become more aware of my actions and how I can align them with the teachings of the gospel.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This experience has helped me refine my portfolio so that all the sections reflect my character traits consistently. I no longer present merely what I know how to do in IT but instead present who I am as a disciple-leader. The fusion of my faith and professional growth has given me a stronger sense of direction and defined the kind of leader I am becoming.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Task 2: Usability Testing and Design Enhancements Report</h2>
    
      <p>
        To enhance my GitHub portfolio's usability, I also did a quick usability test by visiting the site as a first-time user from different screen sizes and devices. This helped me identify the usability issues, including the ease of navigation, readability of the text, the look and feel of the visuals, and the overall accessibility of the site.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        After conducting this quick usability test, I made several enhancements to the design of my GitHub portfolio. These enhancements include improvements to the overall navigation of the site, the order of headings, and the use of white space and typography. I also made improvements to the sections of the site, including the clear division of information regarding spiritual development, professional development, ethical development, and future direction.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        These enhancements have greatly improved the user experience because of the simplicity and engagement of my GitHub portfolio. The new design shows professionalism while also being sincere and reflective of my spiritual identity, while clearly connecting my technical and spiritual growth.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Ethical Dilemma Reflection</h2>
    
      <p>
        One ethical dilemma that I ponder on during my IT studies is the abuse of administrative privileges. This is because those authorized to use administrative privileges have the highest access to sensitive information and may want to use such information for their own convenience or gain. While technical controls such as audits and logs are important, the main factor remains the personal integrity of the individual.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The approach I will take in the future when handling similar situations is based on accountability, self-discipline, and agency. Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–28 teaches that we are accountable for our own choices. This means acting ethically even when no one is watching. Ethical behavior is not a restriction but a responsibility.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Reflecting on this ethical dilemma has strengthened my understanding that technical skills alone are not sufficient without integrity. As a follower of Jesus Christ, I am accountable not only to employers and users but also to the Lord. This realization strengthens my commitment to using my skills to protect and serve others rather than to take advantage of them.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Task 3: Spiritual–Professional Integration Reflection</h2>
    
      <p>
        Participating in spiritual practices such as attending the temple and engaging in meditation has helped me see my life as a unified whole rather than separate spiritual and professional paths. In sacred settings, I have learned how preparation, organization, and purpose mirror the qualities required of a strong IT professional. Being prepared and serving with intent are lessons that directly apply to leadership and systems administration.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The teachings from the provided resources, especially those related to unity, belonging, and resolving contention, have reshaped my understanding of leadership. Scriptures such as Doctrine and Covenants 38:27 remind me that leadership involves creating environments where people feel valued and included. In professional settings, this means addressing challenges with humility rather than authority.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This reflective experience has shown me that my professional skills are tools for service. Networking, systems administration, and technical support are meaningful when they are used to bless others and promote peace rather than conflict. My faith provides the moral compass that guides how I use my skills, and my professional experiences give me opportunities to live Christlike principles in visible and practical ways.
