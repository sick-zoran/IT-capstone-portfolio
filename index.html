<h1>Kouadio Jean-Jaures Dominique N’GUESSAN</h1>
<h2>Information Technology Professional & Disciple-Leader</h2>

<p>
Welcome to my professional and spiritual portfolio. This site represents the integration of my technical
development in Information Technology with my growth as a disciple of Jesus Christ. Inspired by Elder
David A. Bednar’s analogy of intertwined strands, this portfolio reflects how faith, principles, and
professional practice work together to create strength, purpose, and integrity.
</p>

<p>
My goal is to become a trusted IT professional in networking and systems administration while living values
of integrity, diligence, accountability, and service. This portfolio is a living document that will continue
to grow as I learn, serve, and develop professionally.
</p>

<h2>Spiritual Progression Portfolio</h2>

<h3>Guiding Principle 1: Faith in Jesus Christ as the Source of Peace and Direction</h3>

<p>
Faith in Jesus Christ is the foundation of my personal and professional life. Through prayer, scripture study,
and reflection, I have learned that true peace comes from trusting the Savior, even during uncertainty and
pressure. In the IT field, challenges such as system failures, complex troubleshooting, and time constraints
are common. Faith allows me to approach these challenges calmly, patiently, and with confidence that the
Lord can guide my efforts.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>3 Nephi 13:19–22</li>
    <li><em>Jesus Christ: The Prince of Peace</em></li>
    <li>Personal spiritual reflections</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Guiding Principle 2: Integrity and Accountability Through Agency</h3>

<p>
Agency is a divine gift that carries responsibility. Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–28 teaches that we are
agents unto ourselves and accountable for our choices. In Information Technology, integrity is essential
because professionals are entrusted with sensitive systems and data. I am committed to acting ethically,
respecting boundaries, and using access responsibly, even when misuse could go unnoticed.
</p>

<strong>Supporting Materials:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–28</li>
    <li>Assigned course reading on agency and values</li>
    <li>Ethical reflections from academic and professional experiences</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Guiding Principle 3: Diligence and Reverence in Responsibilities</h3>

<p>
Reverence and diligence apply not only to sacred spaces but also to professional responsibilities. Through
temple teachings and service, I have learned that preparation, consistency, and gratitude lead to growth.
This principle motivates me to value learning opportunities, approach work with respect, and remain
committed to continuous improvement.
</p>

<strong>Supporting Materials:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>Don’t Take the Temple for Granted</em></li>

<h3>Projects and Experience</h3>

<h4>Network Configuration and Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>
Configured routers, switches, VLANs, DHCP, and DNS using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project strengthened
my understanding of network design and reinforced the importance of precision, patience, and accountability.
</p>

<h4>Server Administration and User Support</h4>
<p>
Supported system access, resolved user issues, and maintained system reliability. This experience highlighted
the importance of ethical responsibility and trust in system administration roles.
</p>

<h4>IT Support and Customer Service Integration</h4>
<p>
Provided technical support while communicating clearly with users. This experience taught me that empathy
and service are essential components of effective IT work.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Ethics and Leadership</h2>

<h3>Ethical Dilemma: Misuse of Administrative Privileges</h3>

<p>
System administrators often have elevated access to sensitive data and systems. An ethical dilemma arises
when such access is used for purposes outside professional responsibility. While organizations may respond
through audits and disciplinary actions, ethical behavior ultimately depends on individual integrity.
</p>

<p>
This dilemma reinforced my belief that agency and values must guide technical ability. As a disciple of Jesus
Christ, I am accountable for how I use entrusted authority, both professionally and spiritually.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Reflection: Spiritual and Professional Integration</h2>

<p>
Serving as a temple worker and coordinator taught me the power of preparation and reverence. Arriving early
to meditate and invite the Spirit brought peace, joy, and a stronger desire to serve others. This experience
shaped how I lead, prepare, and interact with others professionally.
</p>

<p>
My spiritual discipline strengthens my professional conduct, and my professional growth deepens my
spiritual maturity. When faith, effort, and integrity are aligned, they form a strong foundation for lifelong
growth.

  <h2>Network Administration Project – Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    The Network Configuration and Systems Administration project represents a
    meaningful application of the technical and ethical principles developed
    throughout my coursework. The project demonstrates practical skills in
    configuring network infrastructure, managing core services such as DHCP and
    DNS, and ensuring reliable connectivity across systems. More importantly, it
    reflects my growing understanding of how technical decisions directly affect
    security, trust, and long-term system sustainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the key challenges addressed during refinement was improving clarity,
    scalability, and maintainability. While the original configuration met
    functional requirements, the project was strengthened through clearer
    documentation and improved structural organization. These refinements ensure
    the system can be easily understood and maintained by other administrators,
    reducing operational risk and supporting long-term continuity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ethical considerations were intentionally integrated through improved access
    control and accountability. Administrative privileges were refined to align
    with the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have access
    necessary for their responsibilities. Documentation practices were also
    enhanced to promote transparency, traceability, and responsible system
    management.
  </p>

  <p>
    These refinements had a direct impact on both technical quality and ethical
    alignment. The system became more secure, scalable, and maintainable, while
    also reflecting professional responsibility and trustworthiness. This
    project demonstrates how ethical leadership in IT is expressed through
    everyday configuration and design decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, this experience strengthened my ability to approach IT work with
    intentionality, discipline, and accountability. It reinforced the idea that
    effective technology solutions require both technical expertise and ethical
    awareness, preparing me to serve organizations and communities responsibly
    through technology.
  </p>

    <h2>Future Direction</h2>

<p>
I am committed to continued learning, ethical leadership, and service-oriented technology practice. This
portfolio will continue to evolve as I gain experience, pursue advanced certifications, and grow as both an
IT professional and disciple-leader.
